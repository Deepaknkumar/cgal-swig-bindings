Scilab unit tests are contained in the unit_tests/ subdirectory.  To run them,
the bindings must be built within a build/ subdirectory of the project root
directory.  Then, in Scilab, switch to the project root directory and run:

    test_run(pwd())

A specific test name or matrix of test names can be given as the second
argument:

    test_run(pwd(), 'load')
